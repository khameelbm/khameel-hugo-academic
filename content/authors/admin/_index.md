<!-- I am an Associate Professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Nottingham Malaysia. My primary research interest gears towards mechanics and modelling of microscale structures, but I have wider interest that encompasses computational mechanics, engineering teaching philosophy and mechanics of advanced systems (functionally graded materials, sandwich composites, biological structures, energy materials, additively manufactured components). -->
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
  My research is dedicated to issues at the interface of computational structural mechanics, advanced materials, and additive manufacturing. 


It broadly covers the areas of computational structural analysis, mechanics of sustainable/functional materials, and polymer-based 3D Printing. 


Concretely, the overarching objective of my research centres around developing robust computational models, efficient computational solutions and experimental structural assessment towards uncovering load-bearing capacity, strength limit, dynamic failure modes, and stimuli-responsiveness of mechanical, bio-based/energy systems. 
Specific applications of my research connect to the development of lightweight composite aerospace/automotive parts, flexible sensors based on piezoelectric polymers and thermoelectric materials, and biomedical devices such as stents and hip implants. Expertise includes the following: 
- Industrial-scale linear/non-linear finite element simulations
- High-performance data-driven machine-learning techniques
- Polymer-based additive manufacturing of structural and functional devices
- Mathematical modelling of advanced materials
- Dynamic fatigue failure assessment and fracture analysis
- R programming for statistical analysis and design of experiment

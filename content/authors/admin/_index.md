Dr Khameel B. Mustapha is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Mechanical, Materials and Manufacturing Engineering, University of Nottingham (Malaysia). Before joining the University of Nottingham, he held a faculty position with the Swinburne University of Technology (Sarawak). He is a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (UK) and a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. 

He has accumulated years of experience in professional/academic research and teaching activities.
He has authored extensive scholarly publications in the areas mechanics of smart/functional materials, sustainable composite materials, and additive manufacturing. He is the author of three books published in 2018, 2019, and 2022, respectively: <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Finite-Element-Computations-in-Mechanics-with-R-A-Problem-Centered-Programming/Bayo-Mustapha/p/book/9781138501621">Finite Element Computations in Mechanics with R (Taylor & Francis)</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-13-7014-4">R for Finite Element Analyses of Size-dependent Microscale Structures (Springer)</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Finite-Element-Simulations-SOLIDWORKS/dp/1801819920">Practical Finite Element Simulations with SOLIDWORKS 2022 (Packt Publishing Company UK)</a>.



Concretely, the overarching objective of his research centres around developing robust computational models/solutions and experimental assessments towards optimizing the properties and performance of mechanical, bio-based and energy-related systems. Specific applications of his research connect to the development of lightweight composite parts, flexible devices based on piezoelectric polymers/thermoelectric materials, and biomedical devices such as stents and hip implants. 

Expertise includes the following:
 
 - Mathematical modelling of advanced materials
 - Industrial-scale finite element analysis (linear/nonlinear)
 - Applied machine learning 
 - Polymer-based additive manufacturing of structural and functional devices
 - Fatigue failure assessment and fracture analysis
 - R and Python programming for data-driven analyses
